#### Application of Artificial Neural Networks & Quadratic Programming in Portfolio Management üìàüí∞

A collection of repositories containing my **Final Master's Thesis**, where I explore the application of **artificial neural networks** and **quadratic programming** in financial portfolio management.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Characterization of financial time series for improved forecasting.
- Integration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to enhance predictive capabilities.
- Application of quadratic programming for optimal asset allocation.
- Challenges and opportunities in AI-driven portfolio management.

#### LSTM Networks for Time Series Forecasting üìäüîÆ

A project dedicated to automating a methodology for implementing **long short-term memory (LSTM) networks** in time series forecasting. This repository serves as a central hub for structured experimentation, model evaluation, and deployment strategies, enabling efficient and reproducible forecasting processes.
